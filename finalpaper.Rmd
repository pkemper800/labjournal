# Introduction

Academic publications play a pivotal role not only in knowledge generation for the public and sectoral development by progressing methodological precision and empirical findings, but in the individual career progression, collaborations, and preferences of professors as leading figures in their fields. Publications, typically referring to academic articles, books, or literature published by an official academic journal, can be written and published by individual professors as well as partners or groups of professors working together in collaboration. These publications are important to establishing credibility and paving the way for potential promotions in academia, and collaborations on publications can further support professors’ reputation and reinforce their credibility (Wuchty et al. 867 ). Importantly, individual characteristics and structural opportunities can shape collaboration patterns, with gender and gender representation in academic settings influencing publication patterns (McPherson et al. 415 ). 

In academia, we see that women still experience differences in publications, full professorships, and representation in university leadership positions despite similar proportions of men and women attaining PhDs in the Netherlands (https://bashofstra.com/files/qss2024.pdf  ). While women enter academic publishing careers at equal rates to men, they leave sooner (Mulders, Hofstra & Tolsma (2024). Furthermore, despite near-even representation of gender (known as gender parity) at the doctoral level, with 48.1% of doctoral graduates across the European Union being women, women remain severely underrepresented in senior positions: Only 26.2% of full-professors are women, with widening publication gaps at higher career stages (https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/67d5a207-4da1-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1/language-en). While there have been notable improvements in promoting gender equity in academia, women remain underrepresented in senior academic positions in the Netherlands, particularly in political science (LNVH, 2021 ). Conversely, sociology has achieved greater gender balance over recent years in the Netherlands (Landelijk  Netwerk Vrouwelijke Hoogleraren 12). 

Academic collaboration networks play an important role in career advancement and the formation of intellectual communities within disciplines. These networks are shaped by both structural opportunities and social preferences (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Morevover, academic collaboration networks influence professors’ access to resources, research productivity, visibility within the field, and career mobility (Abramo et al. 1189 - Abramo, D'Angelo, & Di Costa, 2019). Furthermore, it is important to understand the intersection of collaboration patterns with gender dynamics in academia, as women remain underrepresented in many fields. This relational perspective can reveal structural patterns of inclusion and exclusion, and investigating academic collaboration networks in the Netherlands using social network analysis offers the opportunity to investigate collaboration patterns as underlying mechanisms that might explain this continued disparity.

With inequalities persisting against women in academic careers, as women still face differences in publications, full professorships, and representation in university leadership, and publications influencing credibility and potential promotions for professors, it is important to understand how gender interacts with collaboration patterns in publications as a potential area to where inequalities arise. Furthermore, these academic publication networks are ideal models of social networks, with clear egos (or agents) as the professors/authors of articles, and ties as the collaborations (or published academic works). 

Social network analysis is ideal for studying academic collaborations because it treats relationships—not just individuals—as the fundamental unit of analysis. Despite decades of diversity initiatives, gender and ethnic inequality persist in Dutch academia, and social network analysis offers the opportunity to investigate underlying mechanisms such as publication collaboration patterns, that might explain the continued inequality. Examining the difference in collaboration patterns between political science and sociology as disciplines with varying gender compositions is informative as a preliminary indication of how equal gender representation influences collaborations. Additionally, the relatively small and interconnected nature of Dutch academic networks is ideal for social network research, as the comprehensive network boundary specification is easier to define while the prestige remains relatively similar (Mulders et al. (2024) - Mulders et al. 489). 

Further, social network analysis offers an ideal opportunity to investigate the patterns of tie formation – and particularly the tendency for similar agents to form ties, commonly referred to as homophily (CITE)– which is ideal when considering an ego-level characteristic like gender. While homophily is an established finding in social network research (McPherson et al., 2001, 416), its presence in academic collaboration remains underexplored. Moreover, gender homophily in co-authorship could reflect genuine preferences for working with same-gender colleagues, structural constraints that limit opportunities for cross-gender interaction, or the cumulative effects of historical gender imbalances in academic fields (Boschini & Sjögren, 2007).

This research paper will investigate the gender-based patterns in academic collaborations (in the form of shared publications) for political science and sociology professors in the Netherlands. Using social network analysis and longitudinal statistical modeling, I investigate three interrelated questions: First, are there gender differences in overall collaboration rates? Second, what proportion of collaborations occur across gender lines versus within same-gender pairs? And third, does prior experience with cross-gender collaboration increase the likelihood of future cross-gender ties? 

By examining these questions, this study contributes to understanding how academic collaboration networks may reproduce or challenge gender inequality in Dutch universities. The findings have implications for policies aimed at promoting gender equity in academic careers, as they can reveal whether interventions should target structural barriers to cross-gender collaboration, work to shift preferences and norms around collaboration partner selection, or address other mechanisms underlying observed patterns of gender segregation in scholarly networks.
